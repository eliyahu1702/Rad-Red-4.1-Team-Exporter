Ok
this is just a very quick way to import all of your Pokemon Radical Red v4.1 team to a showdown team.
what does it export:
   Species
   Ability
   EV / IV
   Nature
   Moves
   Held Item
   Level
waht does it not export:
   gender
   happieness
   other stuff i probably never noticed when calculating

use this in conjuntion with the showdown radical red battle builder
https://play.radicalred.net/teambuilder
don't blame me on any miscalcs (be sure to double check before uploading to the damage calculator)

Huge thanks to Bulbapedia for the superb data structure explanation
